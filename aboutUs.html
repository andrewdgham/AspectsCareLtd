                                The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health and Social Care of the United Kingdom. It was established in 2009 to regulate and inspect health and social care services in England.

                                It was formed from three predecessor organisations:

                                the Healthcare Commission
                                the Commission for Social Care Inspection
                                the Mental Health Act Commission
                                The CQC’s stated role is to make sure that hospitals, care homes, dental and general practices and other care services in England provide people with safe, effective and high-quality care, and to encourage them to improve. It carries out this role through checks it carries out during the registration process all new care services must complete, inspections and monitoring of a range of data sources that can indicate problems with services.

                                Part of the commission’s remit is protecting the interests of people whose rights have been restricted under the Mental Health Act.
