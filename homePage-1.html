                                    Aspects Care believes that in addition to the basic necessities of life, everyone has the right to safety, security, respect and the provision of good quality culturally sensitive services, combined with a real commitment to offer the highest degree of flexibility a service is able to offer. To ensure our services are second to none we employ staff who are suitably qualified or are willing to train to the high standards we have set and involve the client in the recruitment process.

                                    Aspects Care is a professional organisation specialising in providing high quality care and support workers to a diverse range of Service Users within their home environment.

                                    Our key objective is to ensure the provision of a comprehensive range of professional care and support services. In order for this to happen we rely on our staff to provide a professional service, when representing Aspects Care at our Service Users.
                                    
                                    We are proud of the reputation that we have built but we are always mindful that it is dependant on the people who work with us. Aspects Care’s continuing success depends upon how well we work together, and to achieve this there has to be agreed rules, guidelines, and standards of conduct for all and these are explained in the Employee Handbook in conjunction with the Policy and Procedure Manual.

                        Aspects Care was founded in 2004 with the long term intention 
                        of providing support and care services for clients who wish to 
                        live independently and in their own homes. Our philosophy is 
                        based upon "Care with a Difference".
