                            Aspects Care Citizen’s Involvement 
                            enables Citizens to take an active role within the 
                            company and the service that is delivered by Aspects 
                            Care. This service encourages Citizens to participate 
                            in monthly social activities and events in order to 
                            achieve positive outcomes such as overcoming isolation.

                            The Citizen’s Involvement has also introduced a panel, 
                            in which citizens who access the service can air their
                            views within the company in a more accessible way. 
                            This empowers the citizens to be more active in decisions
                             which may affect them.

                            There are several ways within the Citizens involvement
                             department encourages citizens to be more involved 
                             in the company, such as citizen’s newsletters, citizens
                              meetings, and citizen handouts.
